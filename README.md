# nitrobotv3
A NitroGen created by 𝕄𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗱𝗣𝗼𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗼#0001
Step 1 :You need to install node.js
Step 2 :Go to nitrov3 folder using cd command (If you don't know what to do,just do like me: +extract the nitro gen v3 folder to your Desktop,then open node.js and then type cd Desktop then type this another command : cd nitrobotgen v3)

Step 2 :Create a new bot : discord.com/developers(Do not close node .js)
Step 3 :Enter your token with your token 
in the last line ( replace Enter token here with your bot)
Step 4 :Create a new sever and invite your bot into that sever
Step 5 :On node.js type node index.js
If node.js say Nitrogenv3 is ready,do not close that tab(the bot will go offline)
